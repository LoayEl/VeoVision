"""
Combined 2D Pitch and Heatmap Visualization
============================================
This script processes soccer match videos to create a combined visualization showing:
- 2D tactical pitch with player positions, ball, goalkeepers, and referees
- Voronoi diagram heatmap overlay showing territorial control by each team

The output displays both visualizations side-by-side or overlaid in a single video.

Features:
- Player and ball detection using YOLOv8
- Team classification using SigLIP embeddings
- Goalkeeper team assignment
- Pitch keypoint detection
- Homography transformation to map players to 2D pitch
- Combined visualization with player markers AND Voronoi heatmap
